For the insert random method, the BST was the fastest for the first two tests, but as the input got larger BST slowed significantly, showing array lists are the best for large unordered inputs. The same theme follows for the insert random method for BST, however, AVL tree ended up being the fastest for large-ordered inputs. For the contains random method the AVL tree was the fastest across the board. For the contains-in order method array list was just marginally faster for the first test, however AVL tree ended up being faster for the larger data. Based on this, Iâ€™d say AVL trees are the most efficient data structure, especially for the larger data, whether data is ordered or not.
